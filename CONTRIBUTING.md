# Contributing and developing

Anyone can contribute to Jubilant. It's best to start by [opening an issue](https://github.com/canonical/jubilant/issues) with a clear description of the problem or feature request, but you can also [open a pull request](https://github.com/canonical/jubilant/pulls) directly.

Jubilant uses [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) to manage Python dependencies and tools, so you'll need to [install uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/#installation) to work on the library. You'll also need `make` to run local development tasks (but you probably have `make` installed already).

After that, clone the Jubilant codebase and use `make all` to run various checks and the unit tests:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/canonical/jubilant
Cloning into 'jubilant'...
...
$ cd jubilant
$ make all
...
========== 107 passed in 0.26s ==========
```

To contribute a code change, write your fix or feature, add tests and docs, then run `make all` before you push and create a PR. Once you create a PR, GitHub will also run the integration tests, which takes several minutes.


## Developing in a workshop

If you'd rather not install the tools on your host, the `dev` [Workshop](https://ubuntu.com/workshop) in `.workshop/` is a container with `uv`, `make`, Jubilant's development dependencies, and the [Pi](https://pi.dev) coding agent:

```
$ sudo snap install workshop --classic
$ workshop launch dev
$ workshop run dev all
```

The `all`, `format`, `lint`, and `unit` actions run the `make` targets with the same names. Extra arguments to `unit` are passed to `pytest`, so `workshop run dev unit -k test_defaults` is the same as `make unit ARGS='-k test_defaults'`. The workshop keeps its virtual environment outside the project directory, so it doesn't share or overwrite the `.venv` on your host.

The `pi` action runs Pi in the workshop, with access to the project directory but not the rest of your host. Pi's settings and credentials are kept in a mount, so they survive `workshop refresh`.

There's no integration test action, because the integration tests need a Juju controller. Run them on your host.


## Pull requests

Changes are proposed as [pull requests on GitHub](https://github.com/canonical/jubilant/pulls).

Pull requests should have a short title that follows the [conventional commit style](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/) using one of these types:

- chore
- ci
- docs
- feat
- fix
- perf
- refactor
- revert
- test

Some examples:

- feat: add support for a new `juju status` field
- fix!: correct the handling of apps with no units in `Juju.wait`
- docs: clarify how to run the integration tests

We consider Jubilant too small a project to use scopes, so we don't use them.

Note that the commit messages to the PR's branch do not need to follow the conventional commit format, as these will be squashed into a single commit to `main` using the PR title as the commit message.

To help us review your changes, please rebase your pull request onto the `main` branch before you request a review. If you need to bring in the latest changes from `main` after the review has started, please use a merge commit.


## Doing a release

To create a new release of Jubilant:

1. Draft a release:
   1. [Draft a new release](https://github.com/canonical/jubilant/releases/new) on GitHub. The tag should start with a `v`, like `v1.2.3`.
   2. In the release notes, drop the `by @author` credit for anyone in the Charm Tech team (including Copilot and other AI users), and drop dependabot PRs entirely.
   3. Sort the PRs by type: breaking changes first, then feat, fix, docs, chore, ci.
   4. Add a short summary after the version in the release title, like `v1.2.3: Add foo command, fix bar`.
2. Create a pre-release PR:
   1. Update the `__version__` field in [`jubilant/__init__.py`](https://github.com/canonical/jubilant/blob/main/jubilant/__init__.py) to the new version.
   2. Add a changelog entry to [`CHANGES.md`](https://github.com/canonical/jubilant/blob/main/CHANGES.md) for the new version.
   3. Put the release summary and notes in the PR description for review. Put the notes in a code block to avoid @-ing people.
   4. Get the PR reviewed and merged.
3. Publish the release:
   1. Publish the draft release on GitHub. This triggers the [`publish.yaml` workflow](https://github.com/canonical/jubilant/blob/main/.github/workflows/publish.yaml), which automatically publishes the package to PyPI and runs the SBOM and security scan workflow.
   2. On the summary page of the workflow run, locate the `secscan-report-upload` artifact. Download it and upload it to the [SSDLC Jubilant folder in Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1bLJL4wJwicxaGY2hc5Xz4vSjENUt5Zjw?usp=share_link). Open the report and verify that the security scan has not found any vulnerabilities.
   3. Check that the new version appears in the [PyPI version history](https://pypi.org/project/jubilant/#history).
