Jubilant is a Python library that wraps the [Juju](https://canonical.com/juju) CLI, primarily for use in charm integration tests.

When writing charm integration tests, use Jubilant with `pytest-jubilant`. See {external+operator:ref}`How to write integration tests for a charm <write-integration-tests-for-a-charm>` in the Ops documentation. Ops also has several [demo charms](https://github.com/canonical/operator/tree/main/examples) that you can experiment with. The demo charms use Jubilant in their integration tests.

Jubilant's methods map 1:1 to Juju CLI commands and have a type-annotated, Pythonic interface:

- The main [](jubilant.Juju) class, with methods such as [`deploy`](jubilant.Juju.deploy) and [`integrate`](jubilant.Juju.integrate)
- The [`Juju.wait`](jubilant.Juju.wait) method, which waits for a condition such as "all apps active"
- Status helpers such as [](jubilant.all_active), for use with `Juju.wait`
- Context managers such as [](jubilant.temp_model), for use in test setup and teardown

You should switch to Jubilant if your integration tests currently use [pytest-operator](https://github.com/charmed-kubernetes/pytest-operator). Jubilant avoids some of the pain points of [python-libjuju](https://github.com/juju/python-libjuju/), such as websocket failures and having to use `async`.
