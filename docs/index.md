Jubilant is a Python library that wraps the [Juju](https://juju.is/) CLI for use in charm integration tests. It provides methods that map 1:1 to Juju CLI commands, but with a type-annotated, Pythonic interface.

You should consider switching to Jubilant if your integration tests currently use [pytest-operator](https://github.com/charmed-kubernetes/pytest-operator) (and they probably do). Jubilant has an API you'll pick up quickly, and it avoids some of the pain points of [python-libjuju](https://github.com/juju/python-libjuju/), such as websocket failures and having to use `async`. Read our [design goals](explanation/design-goals).

Jubilant 1.0.0 was released in April 2025. We will avoid making breaking changes to the API after this point.


The library provides:

- The main [](jubilant.Juju) class, with methods such as [`deploy`](jubilant.Juju.deploy) and [`integrate`](jubilant.Juju.integrate)
- The [`Juju.wait`](jubilant.Juju.wait) method, which waits for a condition such as "all apps active"
- Status helpers such as [](jubilant.all_active), for use with `Juju.wait`
- Context managers such as [](jubilant.temp_model), for use in test setup and teardown
