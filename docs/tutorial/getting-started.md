# Getting started with Jubilant

In this tutorial, we'll learn how to install Jubilant and use it to run Juju commands.

The tutorial assumes that you have a basic understanding of Juju and have already installed it. {external+juju:ref}`Learn how to install the Juju CLI <install-juju>`.

This tutorial doesn't cover charm integration tests. To learn how to use Jubilant in charm integration tests, see {external+operator:ref}`How to write integration tests for a charm <write-integration-tests-for-a-charm>`.

## Install Jubilant

Jubilant is published to PyPI, so you can install and use it with your favorite Python package manager:

```
$ pip install jubilant
# or
$ uv add jubilant
```

Like the [Ops](https://github.com/canonical/operator) framework used by charms, Jubilant requires Python 3.10 or above.

## Check your setup

To check that Jubilant is working, use it to add a Juju model and check its status:

```
$ uv run python
>>> import jubilant
>>> juju = jubilant.Juju()
>>> juju.add_model('test')
>>> juju.status()
Status(
  model=ModelStatus(
    name='test',
    type='caas',
    controller='concierge-k8s',
    cloud='k8s',
    version='3.6.14',
    model_status=StatusInfo(
      current='available',
      since='24 Mar 2026 13:47:11+08:00',
    ),
  ),
  machines={},
  apps={},
  controller=ControllerStatus(timestamp='13:47:16+08:00'),
)
```

Compare the status to what's displayed when using the Juju CLI directly:

```
$ juju status --model test
Model  Controller     Cloud/Region  Version  SLA          Timestamp
test   concierge-k8s  k8s           3.6.14   unsupported  13:48:05+08:00

Model "test" is empty.
```

## Deploy a charm

```
$ uv run python
>>> import jubilant
>>> juju = jubilant.Juju(model='test')
>>> juju.deploy('snappass-test')
>>> juju.wait(jubilant.all_active)
>>> # Or wait for just 'snappass-test' to be active (ignoring other apps):
>>> juju.wait(lambda status: jubilant.all_active(status, 'snappass-test'))
Status(
  apps={
    'snappass-test': AppStatus(
      charm='snappass-test',
      charm_origin='charmhub',
      charm_name='snappass-test',
      ...
      units={
        'snappass-test/0': UnitStatus(
          workload_status=StatusInfo(
            current='active',
            message='redis started',
            since='24 Mar 2026 13:50:32+08:00',
          ),
          ...
        ),
      },
    ),
  },
  ...
)
```

This code deploys the `snappass-test` charm from Charmhub and waits for it to become active.

To deploy a charm from a `.charm` file (created by `charmcraft pack`), use `juju.deploy('/path/to/mycharm.charm')`. For an example, see "Write your tests" in {external+operator:ref}`How to write integration tests for a charm <write-integration-tests-for-a-charm-write-your-tests>`.
